# Developer Exercise

## Purpose

Create a basic photo ordering tool based on the images and JavaScript include provided. Thumbnails of the images should display in the order dictated by the include using a grid-based layout, and should be re-orderable by dragging the images to their desired position.

## Requirements

- This should be a completely client-side exercise. Server code to store the new photo order isn’t necessary.
- While the use of libraries is permitted for basic DOM manipulation or event handling, it’s expected that the core content should be original.
- Code should be cross browser compatible. For IE it should work in IE8+.
- As a general rule, this exercise should take 4-5 hours.
- Extra points for style.
